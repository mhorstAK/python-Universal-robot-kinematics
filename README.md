# Universal-robot-kinematics
UR5 and UR10 forward and inverse kinematics, python scripts

Added are two pieces that can plot the position of the UR-5 example robot in the mathmatical vector form.

Make sure all three python files are in the same folder and run '>>> python robotArmPlot.py'. If you zoom in closely to each joint you'll notice orientation vectors as well.
